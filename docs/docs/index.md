# Scout

Scout is an AI-powered data agent platform that lets teams query databases using natural language. Connect your data sources, ask questions in plain English, and get answers as tables, charts, and interactive dashboards — no SQL required.

## Quick start

1. [Install Scout](getting-started/installation.md) — set up the backend and frontend
2. [Create your first project](getting-started/first-project.md) — connect a database and invite your team
3. [Start a conversation](getting-started/first-conversation.md) — ask a question and explore the results

## Features

**Natural language data querying** — Ask questions about your data in plain English. Scout translates your intent into SQL, executes it safely, and returns structured results.

**Artifacts** — Responses can include rich artifacts: charts, dashboards, and interactive visualizations built with React, Plotly, or plain HTML.

**Sharing** — Share artifacts with teammates or stakeholders via secure links with configurable access levels and expiration.

**Recipes** — Save common workflows as reusable recipes with variables, so anyone on your team can re-run them without writing prompts from scratch.
